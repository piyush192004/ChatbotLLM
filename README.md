# ChatbotLLM 🤖

An experimental project exploring **LLM-powered chatbots using LangChain, LangGraph, and external tools**.  
The repository demonstrates how to build progressively more advanced AI assistants including:

- Basic LLM chatbots
- Tool‑augmented agents
- Human‑in‑the‑loop systems
- LangGraph debugging workflows

The goal of this project is to **learn and experiment with agentic AI systems and modern LLM frameworks**.

### Folder Explanation

**1 - BasicChatbot**  
Contains simple chatbot implementations to understand how LLMs respond to prompts.

**2 - HumanAssistance**  
Demonstrates **human-in-the-loop AI workflows** where humans can intervene in agent decisions.

**3 - Debugging**  
Experiments with **LangGraph debugging tools and agent state tracing**.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piyush192004/ChatbotLLM.git
cd ChatbotLLM
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (uv)

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

Activate (Windows):

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

or

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

Example:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

### Running LangGraph Dev Server

```bash
langgraph dev
```

or

```bash
uv run langgraph dev
```

This launches **LangGraph Studio**, allowing you to visualize and debug agent workflows.
